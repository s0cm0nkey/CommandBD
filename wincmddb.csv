 /createglobalobjects
","/setglobalstate <state> - Sets the domain's global migration state to one that corresponds to the value specified by state. You can only set the global migration state to a stable state. The state values include:0 - Start state1 - Prepared state2 - Redirected state3 - Eliminated state
 /getglobalstate - Retrieves the current global migration state for the domain from the local copy of the AD DS database, when run on the PDC emulator. Use this option to confirm that you set the correct global migration state. Important: You should only run this command on the PDC emulator.
 /getmigrationstate - Retrieves the current local migration state for all domain controllers in the domain and determines whether those local states match the current global migration state. Use this option to determine if all domain controllers have reached the global migration state.
 /createglobalobjects - Creates the global objects and settings in AD DS used by DFS Replication uses. The only situations where you should use this option to manually create objects and settings, are:A new read-only domain controller is promoted during migration. If a new read-only domain controller is promoted in the domain after moving into the Prepared state, but before migration to the Eliminated state, then the objects that correspond to the new domain controller aren't created, causing replication and the migration to fail.Global settings for the DFS Replication service are missing or were deleted. If these settings are missing for a domain controller, migration from the Start state to the Prepared state will stall at the Preparing transition state. Note: Because the global AD DS settings for the DFS Replication service for a read-only domain controller are created on the PDC emulator, these settings need to replicate to the read-only domain controller from the PDC emulator before the DFS Replication service on the read-only domain controller can use these settings. Because of Active Directory replication latencies, this replication can take some time to occur.

You shouldn't need to use this option during a normal migration process, because the DFS Replication service automatically deletes these AD DS settings during the migration from the Redirected state to the Eliminated state. Use this option to manually delete the AD DS settings only when the automatic deletion fails on a read-only domain controller and stalls the read-only domain controller for a long ime during the migration from the Redirected state to the Eliminated state.

 /V:<label> - Specifies the volume label. If you omit the /V command-line option or use it without specifying a volume label, format prompts you for the volume label after the formatting is complete. Use the syntax /V: to prevent the prompt for a volume label. If you use a single format command to format more than one disk, all of the disks will be given the same volume label.
 /A:<size> - Specifies the allocation unit size to use on FAT, FAT32, NTFS, exFAT, or ReFS volumes. If you don't specify unit size, it's chosen based on volume size. Default settings are strongly recommended for general use. The following list presents valid values for each type of file system unit size:FAT and FAT32: 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16K, 32K, 64K.

 /Q - Performs a quick format. Deletes the file table and the root directory of a previously formatted volume, but does not perform a sector-by-sector scan for bad areas. You should use the /Q command-line option to format only previously formatted volumes that you know are in good condition. Note that /Q overrides /Q.
 /F:<size> - Specifies the size of the floppy disk to format. When possible, use this command-line option instead of the /T and /T command-line options. Windows accepts the following values for size:1440 or 1440k or 1440kb1.44 or 1.44m or 1.44mb1.44-MB, double-sided, quadruple-density, 3.5-inch disk
 /T:<tracks> - Specifies the number of tracks on the disk. When possible, use the /F command-line option instead. If you use the /T option, you must also use the /N option. These options together provide an alternative method of specifying the size of the disk that is being formatted. This option is not valid with the /F option.
 /N:<sectors> - Specifies the number of sectors per track. When possible, use the /F command-line option instead of /N. If you use /N, you must also use /T. These two options together provide an alternative method of specifying the size of the disk that is being formatted. This option is not valid with the /F option.
 /P:<count> - Zero every sector on the volume. After that, the volume will be overwritten count times using a different random number each time. If count is zero, no additional overwrites are made after zeroing every sector. This switch is ignored when /Q is specified.
 /C - NTFS only. Files created on the new volume will be compressed by default.
 /X - Forces the volume to dismount, if necessary, before it's formatted. Any open handles to the volume will no longer be valid.
 /R - NTFS only. Files created on the new volume will be compressed by default.
 /D - UDF 2.50 only. Metadata will be duplicated.
 /L:<state> - NTFS only. Overrides the default size of file record. By default, a non-tiered volume will be formatted with small size file records and a tiered volume will be formatted with large size file records. /L and /L:enable forces format to use large size file records and /L:disable forces format to use small size file records.
 /S:<state> - Specifies support for short filenames. State is either enable or disable. Short names are disabled by default.
 /TXF:<state> - Specifies TxF is enabled/disabled. State is either enable or disable. TxF is enabled by default
 /I:<state> - ReFS only. Specifies whether integrity should be enabled on the new volume. State is either enable or disable. Integrity is enabled on storage that supports data redundancy by default.
 /DAX:<state> - NTFS only. Enable direct access storage (DAX) mode for this volume. In DAX mode, the volume is accessed via the memory bus, boosting IO performance. A volume can be formatted with DAX mode only if the hardware is DAX capable. State is either enable or disable. /DAX is considered the same as /DAX:enable.
 /LogSize::<size> - NTFS only Specifies the size for NTFS log file in kilobytes. The minimum supported size is 2MB, so specifying a size smaller than 2MB will result in a 2MB log file. Zero indicates the default value, which generally depends on the volume size.
 /NoRepairLogs - NTFS only. Disables NTFS repair logs. If the spotfix flag for chkdsk is specified (i.e. chkdsk /spotfix), this will not work.

When a compressed file reaches a certain level of fragmentation, rather than failing to extend the file, NTFS stops compressing additional extents of the file. This was done to allow compressed files to be larger than they normally would be. Setting this value to TRUE disables this feature which limits the size of compressed files on the system. We don't recommend disabling this feature. You must restart your computer for this parameter to take effect.
 disableencryption {
0} - Disables (1) or enables (0) the encryption of folders and files on NTFS volumes. You must restart your computer for this parameter to take effect.
 disablefilemetadataoptimization {
0} - Disables (1) or enables (0) file metadata optimization. NTFS has a limit on how many extents a given file can have. Compressed and sparse files can become very fragmented. By default, NTFS periodically compacts its internal metadata structures to allow for more fragmented files. Setting this value to TRUE disables this internal optimization. We don't recommend disabling this feature. You must restart your computer for this parameter to take effect.
 disablelastaccess {
0} - Disables (1) or enables (0) updates to the Last Access Time stamp on each directory when directories are listed on an NTFS volume. You must restart your computer for this parameter to take effect.
 disablespotcorruptionhandling {
0} - Disables (1) or enables (0) spot corruption handling. Also allows system administrators to run CHKDSK to analyze the state of a volume without taking it offline. We don't recommend disabling this feature. You must restart your computer for this parameter to take effect.
 disabletxf {
0} - Disables (1) or enables (0) txf on the specified NTFS volume. TxF is an NTFS feature that provides transaction like semantics to file system operations. TxF is presently deprecated, but the functionality is still available. We don't recommend disabling this feature on the C: volume. You must restart your computer for this parameter to take effect.
 disablewriteautotiering {
0} - Disables ReFS v2 auto tiering logic for tiered volumes. You must restart your computer for this parameter to take effect.

0} - Encrypts (1) or doesn't encrypt (0) the memory paging file in the Windows operating system. You must restart your computer for this parameter to take effect.
 mftzone <value> - Sets the size of the MFT Zone, and is expressed as a multiple of 200MB units. Set value to a number from 1 (default is 200 MB) to 4 (maximum is 800 MB). You must restart your computer for this parameter to take effect.
 memoryusage <value> - Configures the internal cache levels of NTFS paged-pool memory and NTFS nonpaged-pool memory. Set to 1 or 2. When set to 1 (the default), NTFS uses the default amount of paged-pool memory. When set to 2, NTFS increases the size of its lookaside lists and memory thresholds. (A lookaside list is a pool of fixed-size memory buffers that the kernel and device drivers create as private memory caches for file system operations, such as reading a file.) You must restart your computer for this parameter to take effect.
 quotanotify <frequency> - Configures how frequently NTFS quota violations are reported in the system log. Valid values for are in the range 0 – 4294967295. The default frequency is 3600 seconds (one hour). You must restart your computer for this parameter to take effect.

0}
 disabledeletenotify - Disables (1) or enables (0) delete notifications. Delete notifications (also known as trim or unmap) is a feature that notifies the underlying storage device of clusters that have been freed due to a file delete operation. In addition:For systems using ReFS v2, trim is disabled by default.For systems using ReFS v1, trim is enabled by default.For systems using NTFS, trim is enabled by default unless an administrator disables it.If your hard disk drive or SAN reports that it doesn't support trim, then your hard disk drive and SANs don't get trim notifications.Enabling or disabling doesn't require a restart.Trim is effective when the next unmap command is issued.Existing inflight IO are not impacted by the registry change.Doesn't require any service restart when you enable or disable trim.",System Administration,Disk/Volume Management

Valid only when the Proxy echo only option (/E) and the use SSL options are specified. You must specify security package (/u) and authentication level (/a) in order to use this option.
 /R - Specifies the HTTP proxy. If none, the RPC proxy is used. The value default means to use the IE settings in your client machine. Any other value will be treated as the explicit HTTP proxy. If you do not specify this flag, the default value is assumed, that is, the IE settings are checked. This flag is valid only when the /E (echo Only) flag is enabled.
 /E - Restricts the ping to the RPC/HTTP proxy only. The ping does not reach the server. Useful when trying to establish whether the RPC/HTTP proxy is reachable. To specify an HTTP proxy, use the /R flag. If an HTTP proxy is specified in the /o flag, this option will be ignored. You must specify security package (/u) and authentication level (/a) in order to use this option.

 -hyperv - Specifies the comma-delimited list of components to be included in backup. The identifier can be a component name or component GUID (with or without braces).
 -systemState - Creates a backup that includes the system state in addition to any other items that you specified with the -include parameter. The system state contains boot files (Boot.ini, NDTLDR, NTDetect.com), the Windows Registry including COM settings, the SYSVOL (Group Policies and Logon Scripts), the Active Directory and NTDS.DIT on domain controllers and, if the certificates service is installed, the Certificate Store. If your server has the Web server role installed, the IIS Metadirectory will be included. If the server is part of a cluster, Cluster service information is also included.
 -allCritical - Specifies that all critical volumes (volumes that contain operating system's state) be included in the backups. This parameter is useful if you are creating a backup for full system or system state recovery. It should be used only when -backupTarget is specified; otherwise, the command fails. Can be used with the -include option. Tip: The target volume for a critical-volume backup can be a local drive, but it can't be any of the volumes that are included in the backup.
 -vssFull - Performs a full back up using the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) Caution: Don't use this parameter if you're using a product other than Windows Server Backup to back up apps that are on the volumes included in the current backup. Doing so can potentially break the incremental, differential, or other type of backups that the other backup product is creating because the history that they are relying on to determine how much data to backup might be missing and they might perform a full backup unnecessarily.
 -vssCopy - Performs a copy backup using VSS. All files are backed up but the history of the files being backup up is not updated so you preserve the all the information on which files where changed, deleted, and so on, as well as any application log files. Using this type of backup does not affect the sequence of incremental and differential backups that might happen independent of this copy backup. This is the default value. Warning: A backup copy can't be used for incremental or differential backups or restores.

 -noInheritAcl - Applies the access control list (ACL) permissions that correspond to the credentials provided by the -user and -password parameters to \\<servername>\<sharename>\WindowsImageBackup\<ComputerBackedUp>\ (the folder that contains the backup). To access the backup later, you must use these credentials or be a member of the Administrators group or the Backup Operators group on the computer with the shared folder. If -noInheritAcl is not used, the ACL permissions from the remote shared folder are applied to the \<ComputerBackedUp> folder by default so that anyone with access to the remote shared folder can access the backup.
 -vssFull - Performs a full back up using the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS). All files are backed up, each file's history is updated to reflect that it was backed up, and the logs of previous backups may be truncated. If this parameter isn't used, wbadmin start backup makes a copy backup, but the history of files being backed up is not updated. Caution: Don't use this parameter if you are using a product other than Windows Server Backup to back up apps that are on the volumes included in the current backup. Doing so can potentially break the incremental, differential, or other type of backups that the other backup product is creating because the history that they are relying on to determine how much data to backup might be missing and they might perform a full backup unnecessarily.

 /e:<Enabled> - Enables or disables a log. <Enabled> can be true or false.
 /i:<Isolation> - Sets the log isolation mode. <Isolation> can be system, application or custom. The isolation mode of a log determines whether a log shares a session with other logs in the same isolation class. If you specify system isolation, the target log will share at least write permissions with the System log. If you specify application isolation, the target log will share at least write permissions with the Application log. If you specify custom isolation, you must also provide a security descriptor by using the /ca option.
 /lfn:<Logpath> - Defines the log file name. <Logpath> is a full path to the file where the Event Log service stores events for this log.
 /rt:<Retention> - Sets the log retention mode. <Retention> can be true or false. The log retention mode determines the behavior of the Event Log service when a log reaches its maximum size. If an event log reaches its maximum size and the log retention mode is true, existing events are retained, and incoming events are discarded. If the log retention mode is false, incoming events overwrite the oldest events in the log.
 /ab:<Auto> - Specifies the log auto-backup policy. <Auto> can be true or false. If this value is true, the log will be backed up automatically when it reaches the maximum size. If this value is true, the retention (specified with the /rt option) must also be set to true.
 /ms:<MaxSize> - Sets the maximum size of the log in bytes. The minimum log size is 1048576 bytes (1024KB) and log files are always multiples of 64KB, so the value you enter will be rounded off accordingly.

 /c:<Count> - Sets the maximum number of events to read.
 /e:<Element> - Includes a root element when displaying events in XML. <Element> is the string that you want within the root element. For example, /e:root would result in XML that contains the root element pair <root></root>.
 /ow:<Overwrite> - Specifies that the export file should be overwritten. <Overwrite> can be true or false. If true, and the export file specified in <Exportfile> already exists, it will be overwritten without confirmation.
 /bu:<Backup> - Specifies the path to a file where the cleared events will be stored. Include the .evtx extension in the name of the backup file.
 /r:<Remote> - Runs the command on a remote computer. <Remote> is the name of the remote computer. The im and um parameters do not support remote operation.

 /emsport - Enables or disables Emergency Management Services during setup and after the server operating system has been installed. With Emergency Management Services, you can remotely manage a server in emergency situations that would typically require a local keyboard, mouse, and monitor, such as when the network is unavailable or the server is not functioning properly. Emergency Management Services has specific hardware requirements, and is available only for products in Windows Server 2003. - com1 is applicable only for x86-based computers (not Itanium architecture-based computers). - com2is applicable only for x86-based computers (not Itanium architecture-based computers). - Default. Uses the setting specified in the BIOS Serial Port Console Redirection (SPCR) table, or, in Itanium architecture-based systems, through the EFI console device path. If you specify usebiossettings and there is no SPCR table or appropriate EFI console device path, Emergency Management Serices will not be enabled. - off disables Emergency Management Services. You can later enable it by modifying the boot settings.
 /emsbaudrate - for x86-based computers, specifies the baud rate for Emergency Management Services. (The option is not applicable for Itanium architecture-based computers.) Must be used with /emsport:com1 or /emsport:com2 (otherwise, /emsbaudrate is ignored).

 /m - Specifies that setup copies replacement files from an alternate location. Instructs setup to look in the alternate location first, and if files are present, to use them instead of the files from the default location.
 /makelocalsource - Instructs setup to copy all installation source files to your local hard disk. Use /makelocalsource when installing from a cd to provide installation files when the cd is not available later in the installation.
 /noreboot - Instructs setup to not restart the computer after the file copy phase of setup is completed so that you can run another command.
 /s - Specifies the source location of the files for your installation. To simultaneously copy files from multiple servers, type the /s:<Sourcepath> option multiple times (up to a maximum of eight). If you type the option multiple times, the first server specified must be available, or setup will fail.
 <Sourcepath> - Specifies full source path name.
 /syspart - On an x86-based computer, specifies that you can copy setup startup files to a hard disk, mark the disk as active, and then install the disk into another computer. When you start that computer, it automatically starts with the next phase of setup. You must always use the /tempdrive parameter with the /syspart parameter. You can start winnt32 with the /syspart option on an x86-based computer running Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, or a product in Windows Server 2003. If the computer is running Windows NT version 4.0, it requires Service Pack 5 or later. The computer cannot be running Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Millennium edition.
 <DriveLetter> - Specifies the drive letter.
 /tempdrive - directs setup to place temporary files on the specified partition. for a new installation, the server operating system will also be installed on the specified partition. for an upgrade, the /tempdrive option affects the placement of temporary files only; the operating system will be upgraded in the partition from which you run winnt32.
 /udf - Indicates an identifier (<ID>) that setup uses to specify how a Uniqueness Database (UDB) file modifies an answer file (see the /unattend option). The UDB overrides values in the answer file, and the identifier determines which values in the UDB file are used. For example, /udf:RAS_user,Our_company.udb overrides settings specified for the RAS_user identifier in the Our_company.udb file. If no <UDB_file> is specified, setup prompts the user to insert a disk that contains the $Unique$.udb file.
 <ID> - Indicates an identifier used to specify how a Uniqueness Database (UDB) file modifies an answer file.
 <UDB_file> - Specifies a Uniqueness Database (UDB) file.
 /unattend - On an x86-based computer, upgrades your previous version of Windows NT 4.0 Server (with Service Pack 5 or later) or Windows 2000 in unattended setup mode. All user settings are taken from the previous installation, so no user intervention is required during setup.
